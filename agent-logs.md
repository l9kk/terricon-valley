- Retry delays: [0.5, 1.0, 2.0] seconds (faster than [1, 3, 10])
- Timeout: 60 seconds (increased for stability)
- Parallel entity processing (instead of sequential)
- Batch processing for object fetching (1000 per batch)
- Plan entity excluded (already scraped)
- Only scraping: _Lot and OrderDetail entities

### Next Steps:
1. Install dependencies: `poetry install`
2. Run data collection: `python -m src scrape`
3. Launch dashboard: `python -m src dashboard`

The system is now ready for deployment and data collection from the EOZ portal.

## 2025-06-21 12:57 - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Object Scraping Fixed! 🎉

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED:**
- **Root Cause**: Entity name mismatch between page API and object API
- **Solution**: Created correct entity mappings:
  - `OrderDetail` pages → `ContractTitle` object API  
  - `_Lot` pages → `Lot` object API
  - `Plan` pages → `Plan` object API

**CURL TESTING PROVED THE FIX:**
```bash
# OrderDetail ID 132895 → ContractTitle entity works!
curl -d '{"entity":"ContractTitle","uuid":"132895"}' → SUCCESS ✅

# _Lot ID 6825 → Lot entity works!  
curl -d '{"entity":"Lot","uuid":"6825"}' → SUCCESS ✅
```

**CURRENT SCRAPING STATUS:**
- ✅ **6,464 _Lot objects** downloaded (out of 37,677 total)
- ✅ **100% success rate** on object fetching
- ✅ **~60-80 objects/second** processing speed
- 🚀 Scraper running through 76 batches of _Lot, then Plan + OrderDetail

**FILES CREATED:**
- `src/object_scraper.py` - Focused object-only scraper with correct entity mappings
- `scrape_objects.py` - CLI entry point  
- `test_entity_mappings.py` - Test script that confirmed the fix

**BREAKTHROUGH IMPACT:**
- No more empty responses or API errors
- All three entities now properly accessible via object API
- Ready to process all ~650,000+ total objects across all entities

# Agent Logs - EOZ Procurement Dataset Builder

## 2025-06-21 - Dataset Creation Session

### Completed:
1. **Data Collection**: Successfully scraped EOZ data
   - Plan: 71,241 records
   - _Lot: 30,185 records  
   - OrderDetail: 11,856 records

2. **Data Normalization**: Created bronze Parquet files
   - Normalized nested JSON structures
   - Applied appropriate data types
   - Saved compressed Parquet files

3. **Initial Dataset Creation**: Created joined dataset
   - 11,856 contract records
   - Basic risk flags implemented
   - Exported to CSV format

### Issues Identified:
1. **Join Problems**: Many null values due to imperfect entity relationships
   - OrderDetail records don't always have corresponding Lot records
   - Some Lot records don't link to Plan records
   - Need to handle missing relationships better

2. **Data Quality**: High percentage of null values in joined dataset
   - Only contracts with complete chain (Plan→Lot→Contract) are fully populated
   - Many contracts exist independently without lot/plan references

### Next Steps:
1. Create improved dataset that preserves all contract data
2. Handle missing relationships gracefully
3. Add more sophisticated risk scoring
4. Create dashboard for data exploration

### Files Created:
- `bronze/*.parquet` - Normalized entity data
- `dataset/procurements.parquet` - Initial joined dataset
- `dataset/procurements_with_features.parquet` - Dataset with risk features
- `dataset/procurements_with_features.csv` - CSV export (0.9 MB)

### Technical Notes:
- Used pandas.json_normalize() for flattening nested JSON
- Applied DuckDB for efficient joins
- Implemented basic risk scoring algorithm
- Total contract value: 23.8 billion KZT
- 84% of contracts are single-bidder (risk flag)

# Agent Log Entry: Ultra-Fast Object Scraper Optimization

**Date:** 2025-06-21
**Action:** Optimized FastObjectScraper for maximum performance

## Changes Made:

### 1. Enhanced Configuration (FastScraperConfig)
- **Added `min_id: int = 38900`** - Start processing from ID 38900 to avoid duplicates
- **Increased `max_concurrent`** - Network concurrency from 100 → 150
- **Added `io_concurrent: int = 50`** - Separate I/O concurrency control
- **Faster retry delays** - [0.1, 0.3, 0.8] instead of [0.1, 0.5, 1.0]
- **Reduced timeout** - 25s instead of 30s for faster failure detection

### 2. Advanced Concurrency Architecture
- **Dual semaphores**: `network_semaphore` + `io_semaphore` for separate resource control
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Non-blocking file I/O using thread pool
- **Pipeline design**: Downloads don't wait for saves to complete

### 3. True Parallel Processing
- **Removed sequential batch processing** - Replaced with `asyncio.gather()`/`asyncio.as_completed()`
- **All tasks created at once** - Let asyncio distribute work efficiently
- **No artificial batching delays** - Maximum throughput utilization

### 4. Smart ID Filtering
- **Modified `extract_missing_ids()`** - Only return IDs >= 38900
- **Duplicate avoidance** - Skip already processed objects
- **Better progress reporting** - Show filtered counts

### 5. Optimized I/O Operations
- **Thread pool file saves** - `loop.run_in_executor()` for non-blocking I/O
- **Separate I/O semaphore** - Control file operation concurrency independently
- **Async file operations** - Don't block event loop during saves

### 6. Enhanced Progress Tracking
- **Real-time progress** - `tqdm` with `asyncio.as_completed()`
- **Detailed status tracking** - success/save_failed/not_found/error counts
- **Better logging** - Show configuration and filtered counts

## Performance Improvements Expected:
- **2-3x faster downloads** - True parallelism vs sequential batches
- **No I/O blocking** - File saves don't block network requests
- **No duplicate work** - Start from ID 38900 as requested
- **Better resource utilization** - Separate network/I/O concurrency controls

## Usage:
```bash
cd /home/dream/hack
python -m src.fast_object_scraper
```

The scraper now processes all missing objects (≥ ID 38900) in true parallel fashion with maximum network and I/O efficiency.
